  The Minutes takes a look at the inner-workings of a city council meeting in
  the small town of Big Cherry—and the hypocrisy, greed, and ambition that
  follow. This powerful, resonant, and funny portrayal of democracy in action
  proves that everything you know can change—it’s just a matter of minutes.
  After all, the smallest towns keep the biggest secrets.
