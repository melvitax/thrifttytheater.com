  What is Britain’s (second most) famous executioner to do now that hanging has
  been abolished? The simple answer is a lot more than he bargained for. In his
  small pub in the northern English town of Oldham, Harry is something of a
  local celebrity and the cub reporters and pub regulars are dying to hear
  Harry’s reaction to the news, while his old assistant Syd and the mysterious
  Mooney lurk with very different motives for their visit.
