  The Olivier Award-nominated hit musical is now on Broadway! Divorced,
  beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived. From Tudor Queens to Pop
  Princesses, the wives of Henry VIII take the mic to reclaim their identities
  out of the shadow of their infamous spouse—remixing five hundred years of
  historical heartbreak into an exuberant celebration of 21st century girl
  power. The female cast are backed by an all-female band, the “Ladies in
  Waiting.” Six is co-directed by Lucy Moss and Jamie Armitage, featuring
  choreography by Carrie-Anne Ingrouille.
