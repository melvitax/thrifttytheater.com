description: >-
  Daniel Hillard, a struggling, out-of-work actor, will do anything for his
  kids. After losing custody in a messy divorce, he disguises himself as
  Scottish nanny Euphegenia Doubtfire in a desperate attempt to stay in their
  lives. As his new persona begins to take on a life of her own, Mrs. Doubtfire
  teaches Daniel more than he bargained for about how to be a father. A
  hysterical and heartfelt story about holding onto your loved ones against all
  odds, Mrs. Doubtfire is the next big musical comedy for families â€” of all
  kinds.
