  A new musical from James Lapine, Tom Kitt and Michael Korie. 1950's Hollywood.
  You are in Malibu with Cary Grant, Clare Boothe Luce and Aldous Huxley and
  they are on an acid trip. Together. All three of these extraordinary people
  were known to experiment with LSD– it was legal then and used for
  self-awareness and psychological exploration. Nobody knows if they ever really
  shared a trip, but they were all in and around LA in the 1950s... Who’s to say
  it never happened?
